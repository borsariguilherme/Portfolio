In this repository I stored some Data related projects.

Some are part of the Capstone Project assignment for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate.
It contains a project using a space launch company historical data to make a cost-saving machine-learning prediction. 

We predict if the Falcon 9 first stage rockets will land successfully. 
SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage.
Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.

Also I have some solved exercices, made for practicing purposes.
